Scoring Model:
Building a credit scoring model that predicts the probability of a client defaulting on their loan automatically. Utilizing various data sources, including behavioral data and information from other financial institutions. Implementing and evaluating the model using cross-validation, GridsearchCV, or equivalent techniques. Considering and addressing class imbalance issues in the data. Optimizing hyperparameters and comparing model performance using relevant metrics, such as AUC and accuracy.

Interactive Dashboard:
Developing an interactive dashboard for customer relationship managers. Including features to visualize scores and interpret them for non-technical users. Providing descriptive information about individual clients with a filtering system. Enabling the comparison of client information to the entire client base or similar groups. Using Streamlit for implementing the dashboard.

Model Deployment:
Deploying the scoring prediction model as an API using Flask. Deploying the interactive dashboard on a platform like Amazon EC2. Ensuring the API is independent of the dashboard, and the latter queries the API for predictions.

MLOps and Data Drift Analysis:
Implementing MLOps practices for automating and industrializing the model's lifecycle management. Testing the use of the evidently library to detect data drift in production. Using the "application_train" dataset for modeling and the "application_test" dataset for simulating new clients in production. Analyzing data drift using the HTML analysis table generated by evidently.

Technical Specifications

Libraries and Tools

Using mlflow for experiment tracking and model storage. Implementing the dashboard using Streamlit. For model deployment, using Flask. Leveraging evidently for data drift analysis. Using version control with Git.

Project Structure

Organizing code and notebooks in a version-controlled repository on GitHub. Providing clear documentation and comments in the code for readability and collaboration. Note Methodologique Including a technical note presenting the entire model development process, from preprocessing to data drift analysis. Discussing the methodology, class imbalance handling, cost-sensitive optimization, and model evaluation metrics. Providing a summary table of results, global and local model interpretability insights, limitations, and possible improvements.
